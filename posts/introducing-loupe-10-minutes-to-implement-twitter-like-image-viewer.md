3 months ago, my boss requested me to implement a Twitter-like image viewer in our app. It supports pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-dismiss gesture.

Letâ€™s see how the twitterâ€™s image viewer works.

### Twitterâ€™s imageÂ viewer

**Androidâ€™s specification**

*   supports scrolling when zoomed in
*   supports over scaling
*   supports swipe-to-dismiss gesture with shared elements transition when zoomed out
*   supports horizontal paging

**iOSâ€™s specification**

*   supports scrolling & flinging when zoomed in
*   supports over scrolling & scaling
*   supports swipe-to-dismiss gesture with vertical translate animation when zoomed out
*   supports horizontal paging

Super coolâ€¦How can I implement this? ðŸ¤”

### Any libraries?

There are many libraries for image zooming.

[https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView](https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView)

Although these great libraries provide pinch-to-zoom gesture, does not provide swipe-to-dismiss gesture(for now) ðŸ˜«

### How about using Behavior with existing libraries?

First, I have tried to use **CoordinatorLayout.Behavior(**[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.Behavior](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.Behavior)**)** with existing libraries.

I wrote the below code.

It seems to work with normal ImageView.

But, in the case of PhotoView, behavior does not work ðŸ˜¿

Looks like Behaviorâ€™s touch event handling is conflicting with PhotoViewâ€™s ðŸ¤”

[https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/blob/master/photoview/src/main/java/com/github/chrisbanes/photoview/PhotoViewAttacher.java#L127](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/blob/master/photoview/src/main/java/com/github/chrisbanes/photoview/PhotoViewAttacher.java#L100)

This method block was suspicious, but I didnâ€™t realize how to fix this issueÂ .

And I tried the other libraries, but the results were similar ðŸ˜µ

I thought I need to handle the whole TouchEvent of the ImageView by myself.

After two months of work in my private timeâ€¦finally, I released a new library!

### Loupe

[**igreenwood/loupe**  
_Loupe is an ImageView Helper for Android that supports zooming and swipe-to-dismiss action. Loupe provides modern imageâ€¦_github.com](https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe "https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe")[](https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe)

*   supports scrolling & flinging when zoomed in
*   supports over scrolling & scaling
*   supports two type swipe-to-dismiss gesture(shared elements transition & vertical translate animation)
*   supports horizontal paging
*   written in Kotlin
*   just a helper class of ImageView. So you can attach it to any ImageView you want. And working perfect with any image loader libraries.

### How toÂ use?

Create `Loupe` instance with your ImageView and implement the `onViewTranslateListener`. Code sample in Activity is something like this. (Loupe also works in Fragments)

val loupe = Loupe(imageView, container).apply { // imageView is your full screen ImageView and container is the direct parent of the ImageView

  onViewTranslateListener = object : Loupe.OnViewTranslateListener {

    override fun onStart(view: ImageView) {  
        
    }

    override fun onViewTranslate(view: ImageView, amount: Float) {  
        
    }

    override fun onRestore(view: ImageView) {  
        
    }

    override fun onDismiss(view: ImageView) {  
      finish()  
    }  
  }  
}

Thatâ€™s all. See? Itâ€™s easy ðŸ˜†
