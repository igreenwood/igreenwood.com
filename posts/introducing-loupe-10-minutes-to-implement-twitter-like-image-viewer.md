3 months ago, my boss requested me to implement a Twitter-like image viewer in our app. It supports pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-dismiss gesture.
Letâ€™s see how the twitterâ€™s image viewer works.

## Twitterâ€™s imageÂ viewer

![Twitter's image viewer(Android)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zOf7LARpXPavlWO-2nCm0A.gif)

**Androidâ€™s specification**

* supports scrolling when zoomed in
* supports over scaling
* supports swipe-to-dismiss gesture with shared elements transition when zoomed out
* supports horizontal paging

**iOSâ€™s specification**

* supports scrolling & flinging when zoomed in
* supports over scrolling & scaling
* supports swipe-to-dismiss gesture with vertical translate animation when zoomed out
* supports horizontal paging

Super coolâ€¦How can I implement this? ðŸ¤”

## Any libraries?

There are many libraries for image zooming.

*[https://github.com/sephiroth74/ImageViewZoom](https://github.com/sephiroth74/ImageViewZoom)
*  [https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView](https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView)

Although these great libraries provide pinch-to-zoom gesture, does not provide swipe-to-dismiss gesture(for now) ðŸ˜«

## How about using Behavior with existing libraries?

First, I have tried to use **CoordinatorLayout.Behavior(**[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.Behavior](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.Behavior)**)** with existing libraries.

I wrote the below code.

[VerticalSwipeDismissBehavior.kt](https://gist.github.com/igreenwood/401b3789554c324d013fc66da96bdd2d#file-verticalswipedismissbehavior-kt)

It seems to work with normal ImageView.

But, in the case of PhotoView, behavior does not work ðŸ˜¿

Looks like Behaviorâ€™s touch event handling is conflicting with PhotoViewâ€™s ðŸ¤”

[https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/blob/master/photoview/src/main/java/com/github/chrisbanes/photoview/PhotoViewAttacher.java#L127](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/blob/master/photoview/src/main/java/com/github/chrisbanes/photoview/PhotoViewAttacher.java#L100)

This method block was suspicious, but I didnâ€™t realize how to fix this issueÂ .
And I tried the other libraries, but the results were similar ðŸ˜µ
I thought I need to handle the whole TouchEvent of the ImageView by myself.

After two months of work in my private timeâ€¦finally, I released a new library!

## Loupe

[**igreenwood/loupe**  
Loupe is an ImageView Helper for Android that supports zooming and swipe-to-dismiss action. Loupe provides modern imageâ€¦_github.com](https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe "https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe")[](https://github.com/igreenwood/loupe)

* supports scrolling & flinging when zoomed in
* supports over scrolling & scaling
* supports two type swipe-to-dismiss gesture(shared elements transition & vertical translate animation)
* supports horizontal paging
* written in Kotlin
* just a helper class of ImageView. So you can attach it to any ImageView you want. And working perfect with any image loader libraries.

### How toÂ use?

Create `Loupe` instance with your ImageView and implement the `onViewTranslateListener`. Code sample in Activity is something like this. (Loupe also works in Fragments)

```kotlin
val loupe = Loupe(imageView, container).apply { // imageView is your full screen ImageView and container is the direct parent of the ImageView

  onViewTranslateListener = object : Loupe.OnViewTranslateListener {

    override fun onStart(view: ImageView) {  
        
    }

    override fun onViewTranslate(view: ImageView, amount: Float) {  
        
    }

    override fun onRestore(view: ImageView) {  
        
    }

    override fun onDismiss(view: ImageView) {  
      finish()  
    }  
  }  
}
```

Thatâ€™s all. See? Itâ€™s easy ðŸ˜†
